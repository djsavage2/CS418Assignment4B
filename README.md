## To get JDBC working:
  - Navigate to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries
  - Click Classpath
  - Hit Add External JARs...
  - navigate it to ojdbc6.jar (can be downloaded here: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-112010-090769.html>
  
## To get SWT working (GUI):
  - Download WindowBuilder from Eclipse Marketplace (Help > Eclipse Marketplace...)
  - Follow this guide: <https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_configure_an_Eclipse_Java_project_to_use_SWT%3F>
  - Download links found here: <https://www.eclipse.org/swt/>
